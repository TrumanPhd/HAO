# HAO
Implementing a deep learning framework from scratch. HAO is a  a deep learning framework with SOTA model structure and GUI. 

I just start this project for fun, and all the code are my love to deep learning

It is my hornor that you can use it, cause this deep learning framework is lighter with no env requirement (only python3.+)

And also, there were no GPU acceleration, the shortage is envident, if you need high performances please use pytorch

However, if you are doing some research with less data, and not skilled coding with SOTA framework, you can use it with our guidence on bilibili and Youtube.
